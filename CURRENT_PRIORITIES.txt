activities. It should be updated often, if possible daily.

CURRENTLY ACTIVE PRIORITIES

1. Integration with Melbourne Uni student project Manual Text/Audio
Alignment. First version is now almost working. The students
officially finish on Oct 25 but can continue, if they wish, until Nov
17.

2. Integration with Melbourne Uni student project Automatic Text/Audio
Alignment. We are currently discussing with the team. The integration
should be very similar to (1) above. Same deadlines.

3. Extension of C-LARA code to support annotated images. This will
enable integration with a second Melbourne Uni project, which is
producing a graphical editing tool for this task. We are working on
adding the relevant extensions and are now perhaps 70% done. Same
deadlines as (1) above.

4. Prepare final version of our paper for ALTA 2023. Deadline is Oct 28.

5. Ongoing discussions about strategies and tools for improving
ChatGPT-4's long-term memory/coherence. We contacted Papr who make the
Papr memory plugin, and they replied. Following up is probably less urgent
since it seems we don't have a problem with Papr Memory: the issue
was really the length of the previous conversation.

6. Ongoing email discussion with Denis about AskTheCode plugin.
No deadline.

PROBABLY ACTIVE SOON

1. Integration with a third Melbourne Uni student project, Voice
Recorder.  An initial API has been added on the C-LARA side. We have
sent doc to the Melbourne Uni team and are waiting for a response.
Same deadlines as Current-1.

2. Explore possibilities for making annotation of multi-words more
accurate. Several ideas have been discussed. No deadline.

3. Installation of C-LARA on UniSA server. Since this has local file
storage, it should be much faster than Heroku, which relies on S3.
We have said the server will released Oct/Nov.

4. Integration of an automatic payment method into the C-LARA server.
The current informal system is not scalable. This is probably
needed for the UniSA server.

5. Improve design aspects of C-LARA. It will be easier to do this when
the vision-enabled ChatGPT-4V becomes generally available. OpenAI says
this will happen soon, probably during October. At least an initial
version is probably needed for the UniSA server.

6. Integration of some version of "phonetic text" into C-LARA, porting
this functionality from the LARA code. Pauline Welby will be visiting
Adelaide Nov 22-25, and we said phonetic text would be the main item to
discuss.

7. Prepare our presentation for WorldCALL, Nov 9-13.

8. Prepare our presentation for "Literacy and Contemporary Society:
Creativity, Equity, Social Action", Dec 4-6.
