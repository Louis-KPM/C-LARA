## Ongoing Activities

Our current activities include the following:

**"Simple C-LARA" interface**

We want to make it easy for children and people unconfident with technology to create C-LARA documents. We are consequently creating a simplified version of the platform, where nearly all processing is done using defaults and the user only needed to input an initial prompt.

**Social network**

We are expanding the initial set of social network functions, to allow people to interact more effectively when posting and discussing C-LARA content.

**Phonetic texts**

For languages where a phonetic lexicon is available (currently Dutch, English, French, German, Icelandic, Romanian and the Oceanic language Drehu), C-LARA now includes functionality to present texts in "phonetic" form, where words are broken down into smaller units associated with phonetic values. This lets beginner learners step through text a sound at a time. We are working on ways to let GPT-4 help more effectively in constructing these resources.

**Images and AI**

We have added a preliminary integration of OpenAI's DALL-E-3, which currently lets the user instruct the AI to add an image based on the whole text. We plan to add further functionality. We will also integrate GPT-4V, so that users can upload an image and tell the AI to construct text from it.
